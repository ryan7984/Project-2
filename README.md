 ## Deployment 

 I used github pages to deploy the website, I did this by carrying out the steps below:

1. I signed up and logged in  to Github.
2. I found the repository for this project, ryan7984/portfolio1 and clicked on it.
3. I then clicked on the Settings link.
4. I clicked on the pages link in the left hand side navigation bar.
5. In the Source section, I chose main from the drop down menu and then I selected root from the 
   drop down select folder menu.
6. I then clicked Save and after some time and a page 
   refresh a message   came up "Your live Github 
   Pages site is now deployed at the URL shown" and a link was then available for me to click and view my website. 

## Testing 

   Testing was ongoing throughout the whole process. I used Chrome developer tools, W3C HTML Validator, W3C CSS Validator (jigsaw) and jshint.

## Unfixed Bugs 

 * Code checked on JSHint using direct input. Note that '//jshint esversion: 6' was entered at the top of the code window prior to pasting in JS code.This ensures that the feedback received from JSHint takes into account that the JS code uses ECMAScript 6 specific syntax.

 ## Credits 

 * I found slack and youtube tutorials most usefull in trying to figure out the javascript code for the game. The youtube tutorials I found most helpful are "Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners" and "JavaScript Programming - Full Course" from freecodecamp.org and the youtube channel "programming with Mosh".
